# Introduction

- This is a web scraper project that I completed. Through the use of Python and BeautifulSoup, this project extracts href attributes and stores them in a separate CSV file.

# What I Learned

- By working on this project, I was able to explore my interest in web scraping and create a tangible tool. In addition, I was able to practice my Git skills and problem solve troubleshooting issues I had with my Integrated Developer Environment (IDE). 

# Areas For Further Learning

- Through my research into this project, I read about advanced web scraping techniques such as proxies. I also read about how CSV files are stored in databases and how firms interpret and utilize the data they acquire. I also read about compliance and regulatory issues that can arise from web scraping, such as personal data and how it can be used within the context of GDPR. 

I hope this project is the start of more web scraping projects that will allow me to deepen my knowledge, gain an understanding of business uses, and provide value to firms.

# Conclusion

I enjoyed this project and I'm always interested in hearing from others. If you want to reach out for any technical or career related reasons, feel free to add me as a connection on LinkedIn!
